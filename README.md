# Malware-Analysis

Keynotes with Malware
----Never analyze malware or suspected malware on a machine that does not have the sole purpose of analyzing malware.<br>
----When not analyzing or moving malware samples around to different locations, always keep them in password-protected zip/rar or other archives so that we can avoid accidental detonation.<br>
----Only Extract malware from password protected zip/rar inside an isolate enviroment<br>
----Ensure all network activity is disabled or monitored<br>
----Once done revert the VM to a clean slate in order to remove any left over residue from the analysis
